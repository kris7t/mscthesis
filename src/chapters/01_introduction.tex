\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro}

Multi-paradigm modeling captures the design of complex systems by employing multiple formalisms and working with multiple levels of abstraction~\citep{Giese06multiparadigm}. Often domain-specific languages~(\textAbbr{DSL}s) or domain-specific modeling languages~(\textabbr{DSML}s) are created as focused formalisms for specific problem domains. Model queries, as well as transformations between formalisms and levels of abstractions provide integration of modeling languages even in complex industrial toolchains.

The viewpoints of reliability, dependability, performability and other quantitative non-functional requirements are of extreme importance in the design of critical systems, which may put significant economic costs or even human life at stake. These requirements are concerned with the probabilistic behaviors of systems. The approximation of metrics of interest with mathematical rigor requires the solution of formal stochastic models by stochastic analysis.

The manual construction of precise formal models often requires specialized expertise. An alternative is the derivation of stochastic models from higher-level engineering formalisms by model transformation, which endows the engineering modeling language with transformational semantics.

In the design of complex systems, such cyber-physical systems and systems-of-systems, the need frequently arises to examine multiple design candidates or to obtain design alternatives that are optimal with respect to some properties. Design-space exploration (\textabbr{DSE})~\citepeg{Vanherpen14patterns} and search-based software engineering (\textabbr{SBSE})~\citepeg{Harman12survey} are concerned with the selection of design candidates by exhaustive or (meta-)heuristic search to satisfy constraints and optimize goals.

When designing complex critical systems, there is a desire to employ \textabbr{DSE} and \textabbr{SBSE} methods to optimize quantitative non-functional requirements. Doing so requires formal stochastic models of the architectures under consideration. However, designing systems directly with formal models may be infeasible, both due to the required specialized expertise, as well as the low level of afforded abstraction. Hence the needs of high-level design with domain-specific languages and low-level, formal analysis are in conflict.

Many approaches have been developed to construct models from a formal analysis viewpoint according to a higher level engineering model~\citepeg{Bernardi03building,Bernardi08umlprofile,Martens10evolutionary,Smith11interoperability}. However, these approaches often restrict themselves to a single, general-purpose engineering modeling language, such as \textabbr{UML}~\citep{Rumbaugh04uml}, Sys\mixedabbr{ML}~\citep{Friedenthal16sysml}, \textabbr{AADL}~\citep{Feiler12aadl} or Palladio~\citep{Becker08palladio}. Therefore, their applicability to multi-paradigm modeling is limited.

We propose a generic approach based on model transformations for the construction of formal stochastic models for instances of any engineering modeling language, including domain-specific modeling languages. A transformation specification provided by the user describes the transformational semantics of the modeling language. We also propose a modular stochastic modeling formalism, which we call reference generalized stochastic Petri nets (\textAbbr{RGSPN}s) to define stochastic model fragments that correspond to elements of the engineering model.

The approach builds on existing transformation methods and formalisms; moreover, common affordances of development environments, such as type checking with strong typing and content assist, are provided for ease of use. Model fragments and transformation specifications can be packaged as a black box so that end users of the source modeling languages do not need to interact with features specific to stochastic modeling.

The transformation engine was designed with the characteristics of \textabbr{DSE} toolchains in mind. We also consider integration with stochastic analysis tools and solvers, as well as empirically validate the scalability of our approach.

In the next sections we review the related works concerning the optimization of stochastic models, especially in the context of model-driven engineering. Then we conclude this chapter by describing our approach in more detail, as well as the structure of this thesis.

\section{Related work: optimization and stochastic modeling}
\label{sec:intro:relwork}

In the literature there are two main approaches to the optimization of designs according to stochastic metrics and constraints. The first approach solves the optimization problem directly on the level of the stochastic model. In this case, traceability links may be followed to pull back the results of the optimization to the engineering design.

In contrast, higher-level methods that perform optimization directly over engineering models are more widespread. However, a downside of the higher-lever approach is that formal models must be constructed from the engineering model to evaluate stochastic metrics, which requires annotating the engineering model or developing a transformation from scratch. Moreover, the lack of deep integration between the transformation and the analysis tool may lead to inefficiencies.

EvoChecker by \citet{Gerasimou15evochecker} was one of the first tools for the optimization of stochastic models using evolutionary techniques, such as the \textabbr{NSGA-II} genetic algorithm~\citep{Deb02nsga}. This approach was extended to support the synthesis of robust designs by \citet{Calinescu17robust} in the \textabbr{RODES} synthesis tool~\citep{Calinescu17rodes}.

The testing---as opposed to the optimization---of non-functional software requirements by search-based techniques is a related area of research. Literature in the area was surveyed by \citet{Afzal09testing}, as well as \citet{Parasa16testing}, who noted the applicability of EvoChecker to the task.

Search-based techniques are also applied to formal models for run time adaptation. \citet{Epifani09adaptation} combined Bayesian estimation and stochastic modeling for run time adaptation in the \textabbr{KAMI} tool. The Activ\mixedabbr{FORMS} runtime environment for architecture-based adaptation employs statistical model checking by simulation to evaluate non-functional requirements~\citep{Iftikhar17activforms}.

Synthesis of optimal policies in Markov decision processes is another common optimization task for stochastic models~\citep{Baier17maximizing}. \citet{Mason17assurance} provided assurance for the correctness of policies learned with reinforcement learning by employing stochastic verification. Abstractions based on Markov decision processes were exploited also by \citet{Quatmann16mdp} for optimizing parameters of stochastic models. 

Conversely, approaches for deriving stochastic models from instances of common,  general-purpose engineering modeling languages are much more numerous. Fourteen \textabbr{UML} profiles for dependability analysis were surveyed by \citet{Bernardi08umlprofile}. A more recent survey on the topic is written by \citet{Koziolek10review}.

A general approach for the optimization of engineering models according to stochastic metrics was proposed by \citet{Koziolek11generic}. They provide an encoding for architectural models that enables the application of search-based techniques, such as genetic algorithms, for optimization. The PerOpteryx~\citep{Martens10evolutionary} framework applies this encoding for architectures defined with the Palladio Component Model~\citep{Becker08palladio} to perform evolutionary optimization. The metrics for optimization can be defined by discrete-event simulations, layered queuing networks~\citep{Franks09lqn} and discrete-time Markov chains~\citep{Koziolek09dependencies}.

We further review the literature on modular stochastic modeling formalisms and queries in \vref{sec:rgspn:relwork}, while some incremental transformation approaches are recalled in \vref{chap:transform:relwork}.

\section{Overview of our approach}
\label{sec:intro:approach}

In our current work we propose an approach for the construction of stochastic models from engineering models without human intervention in order to evaluate automatically derived architecture proposals by stochastic analysis in design-space exploration.

The proposed transformation process is flexible in the sense that---instead of basing our approach on a single engineering modeling language---the creation of transformations for new architectural \textabbr{DSML}s in new problem domains are supported without demanding additional specialized knowledge from the users.

  \label{fig:intro:overview}
\end{figure}

The architecture of the proposed solution is shown in \vref{fig:intro:overview} in the context of design-space exploration and stochastic analysis. Components that are highlighted in bold were developed as part of this work.

Design-space exploration with stochastic metrics is achieved by the interaction of three components. The \emph{design-space explorer} employs (meta-)heuristics to \emph{derive candidate designs} according to the \emph{constraints and goal functions} defined by the user. A candidate design, embodied in some \emph{engineering model} formalism, is analyzed with our toolchain and an external analysis tool, yielding the \emph{values of goal functions and information whether the design satisfies the constraints.} Heuristics account for this information when proposing new designs.

The \emph{stochastic analysis} tool is responsible for solving formal stochastic models, such as continuous-time Markov chains~(see \vref{ssec:background:ctmc}). The model to be solved is given in the \emph{input formalism} of the analysis tool. \emph{Stochastic queries,} such as the computations of dependability and performability metrics or the determination whether some probabilistic safety properties are satisfied, are answered to produce \emph{raw analysis results}. 

The \emph{incremental view model transformation}, which is the main focus of our work, bridges the conceptual gap between the engineering formalism employed in \textabbr{DSE} and the formal stochastic models of stochastic analysis. The \emph{transformation specification} describes how the formal \emph{analysis model} is constructed from engineering models and formalizes the goals and constraints to be analyzed. The analysis model is \emph{exported} to the input format of the analysis tool. The stochastic queries to be posed are also automatically generated from the analysis model in order to enable dependence on its structure.

The raw analysis results are \emph{parsed} after running the external solver to yield the \emph{analysis results.} The results are interpreted according to the traceability links maintained by the view transformation engine to determine the values of goal functions and constraints.

The requirements for the analysis model formalism were determined to be as follows:
\begin{enumerate*}
\item The formalism should be easy to use for engineers, preferably by building on an existing stochastic modeling formalism.
\item Portability and compatibility with a variety of external analysis tools should be ensured.
\item The analysis model should define not only the stochastic model, but also the posed queries for analysis.
\end{enumerate*}

In turn, the transformation engine that assembles the analysis model should satisfy the following requirements:
\begin{enumerate*}
\item The transformation should be \emph{parametric} in the sense that its behavior is determined by the transformation specification provided by the user.
\item The analysis model should be compatible with external analysis tools by avoiding features that are not widely supported in stochastic analysis.
\item End-to-end-traceability should be provided to allow interpretation of analysis results in the context of the engineering model, as well as the analysis model.
\item Incremental execution is preferred, which enables minimizing the work required for updating the analysis model if the engineering model is modified in-place by the \textabbr{DSE} tool. As it will be described in \cref{chap:apply}, in-place modification often occurs in many \textabbr{DSE} paradigms~\citep{Vanherpen14patterns}.
\end{enumerate*}

Our approach differs significantly from existing methods in the literature. In contrast with tools that directly optimize stochastic models~\citepeg{Gerasimou15evochecker,Calinescu17rodes}, we derive an analysis model along with traceability information from engineering models in order to enable design-space exploration with engineering models and stochastic metrics. However, we note that the produced formal models may be transferred to a stochastic model optimizer. The traceability links let user pull back the results of the lower-level optimization to the engineering model; therefore the two approaches can be viewed as complementary.

Compared to transformations for particular modeling languages, such as \textabbr{UML}~\citepeg{Bernardi03building}, our approach is parametric in the transformation specification to allow mappings from any source modeling language. In contrast with the genetic encoding in the PerOpteryx framework~\citep{Koziolek11generic}, our approach does not presume a specific encoding for models and instead transforms the engineering models themselves. However, since our work delegates optimization by design-space exploration to a \textabbr{DSE} tool, such encodings may be employed by the selected design-space explorer.

The rest of this work is structures as follows: \Cref{chap:background} recalls some preliminaries in model-based engineering and stochastic analysis. \Cref{chap:rgspn} proposes a formalism for analysis models based on modular Petri nets~\citep{Kindler09modular} in order to ensure user familiarity and portability across analysis tools. \Cref{chap:transform} presents and incremental transformation engine that uses view transformation and graph query preconditions~\citep{Debreceni14viewmodel} to construct the analysis models. \Cref{chap:apply} describes the application of our transformation framework in \textabbr{DSE} toolchains and empirically evaluates is scalability. Lastly, we conclude our thesis in \cref{chap:conclusion}.

Two case studies are presented as appendices. The dining philosophers case study in \cref{app:phils} is used throughout the thesis as a running example. A more complex example is shown in \cref{app:architecture}, which transforms architectural models to stochastic Petri nets for hazard rate analysis. The latter transformation was used in a collaboration with an industrial partner to evaluate safety requirements in a redundant, self-diagnosing automotive system.
